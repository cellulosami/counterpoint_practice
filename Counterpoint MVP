Absolute Minimum Viable Product:
1. User can push button
2. App generates cantus firmus
3. App displays cantus firmus

- one route (create)
- no database necessary? Counterpoints do not need to be saved. It is definitely useful to have them as a class/model, but technically the database is unecessary and perhaps bloat.
- No API. All generation logic contained within backend



Additional Features:
- First species counterpoint generation
- Second species counterpoint generation
- Third species counterpoint generation
- Fourth species counterpoint generation
- Fifth species counterpoint generation
- Selectable generation parameters:
  - Measure length
  - Key
  - Mode
  - Number of undesirable attributes allowed
  - Specific note values
    - Musical notation
- App displays generated counterpoint as musical notation
- App plays back generated counterpoint
  - App visually follows display while playing back
- Generated counterpoint may be cleanly printed/saved as PDF

-COUNTERPOINT CHECKER
  - A user can input counterpoint as note values
    - A user can input counterpoint as musical notation
  - The program will parse the input for errors and undesirable attributes
    - errors
    - undesirable attributes
  - works for:
    - cantus firmus
    - first species
    - second species
    - third species
    - fourth species
    - fifth species
  - App displays this information to the user
    - as text
    - as notation on the user's input
  - App generates similar counterpoint with recommended changes
